  <p>After a long hiatus from when I first wrote web apps using the now almost defunct Cold Fusion platform, I got back into coding a few years ago with Python. My code is still pretty damn ugly, at least at first, but I love building and creating things that work. I&rsquo;m much more of a plumbing guy when it comes to data architecture; you won&rsquo;t find me building attractive, fancy, whiz-bang web apps. I think most about what happens with data over the long sweep of time.</p>
<p>Partly because of my government career, I&rsquo;ve developed a real passion for getting high quality, usable data into the public domain in forms and structures that let anyone anywhere build trustworthy applications. I&rsquo;m constantly running into cases where the information available to the average person is just not very accessible and reusable from its original form. Lately, I&rsquo;m pushing on what we can do with Wikidata and other aspects of the &ldquo;Global Knowledge Commons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also from my experience, even in some fairly well-funded organizations and circumstances, I tend to keep an eye on the relative longevity (and lack thereof) of the average data amalgamation efforts. It&rsquo;s gotten a lot easier, and to some extent cheaper, to spin up infrastructure online in one or another commercial cloud platform. I&rsquo;ve gotten to be a big fan of Digital Ocean&rsquo;s offerings as one of the most accessible and cost effective in the space.</p>
<p>However, desiging lasting, sustainable architecture is hard work. Code rot, even for real software engineers, sets in quicker than we&rsquo;d like to think. One of the things I&rsquo;m always looking for is some way to leverage someone else&rsquo;s investment in infrastructure that has proven some degree of longevity. With all of the interesting tech and design patterns that have developed in the last decade of cloud-based developments, we can now focus on small little bits of code run as &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; functions that do lots of interesting work in slinging data around. When architected and organized well, those become much more maintainable components that have a better chance of being kept up to date.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find the majority of my code on <a href="https://github.com/skybristol">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Note: There is a mix of repos under my personal account that include some stuff I&rsquo;ve done officially as part of my job. I&rsquo;m slowly working to unwind and move off a bit of that over time to better organize and separate out what I work on.</p>
